This project is named after the Kaluga, the world's biggest freshwater fish, which is found in the icy Amur river.

Kaluga's main goal is to provide access to common features used in cross-platform mobile app development, separated into modules such as architecture (MVVM), location, permissions, bluetooth etc.

To reach this goal it uses Kotlin, specifically [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) which allows running Kotlin code not just on JVM+Android, but also iOS/iPadOS, amongst others (inndeed some kaluga modules also work for Kotlin.js and/or JVM standalone).

Where appropriate coroutines and `Flow` are used in the API. This enables developers to use [cold streams](https://medium.com/@elizarov/cold-flows-hot-channels-d74769805f9) for a modern and efficient design.

While kaluga modules can be used individually, together they form a comprehensive approach to cross-platform development with [shared native code](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-share-on-platforms.html) and native UIs, including SwiftUI and Compose. 

### Short examples

With Kaluga it is possible to create cross-platform functionality in a few lines of code, that would normally take many lines of code even on just one platform. 

Below are some examples, using a [`commonMain` source-set](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mpp-dsl-reference.html#predefined-source-sets):

Scanning for nearby devices with Bluetooth LE:

```kotlin
// will auto request permissions and try to enable bluetooth
BluetoothBuilder().create().devices().collect {
    i("discovered device: $it") // log found device
}
```

Showing a spinner while doing some work:

```kotlin

suspend fun doWork(hudBuilder: HUD.Builder) {
    hudBuilder.presentDuring { // shows spinner while code in this block is running
        // simulate doing work
        delay(1000)
    }
}
    
```

in this case, since HUD is a UI component the builder needs to be configured on the platform side:
```kotlin
val builder = HUD.Builder() // same for iOS and Android
// ...
builder.subscribe(activity) // this needs be done in the Android source-set to bind the HUD to the lifecycle of the Activity
// ...
builder.unsubscribe(activity) // when the Activity is stopped
```

However kaluga's [architecture module](architecture/) offers a cross-platform [`ViewModel`](architecture/src/commonMain/kotlin/viewmodel/ViewModel.kt) class (which extends `androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel` on Android) that will automatically bind the builder to its lifecycle:

```kotlin
// this can just be in the commonMain source
class HudViewModel: BaseViewModel() {

    val hudBuilder = HUD.Builder()

    suspend fun doWork() = 
        hudBuilder.presentDuring {
            delay(1000)
        }
}
```
### More examples

Kaluga contains [an example project](example/) that is used to test the developed modules.

## Using Kaluga

For starting a new project based on kaluga see the [kaluga-starter repo](https://github.com/splendo/kaluga-starter), which shows how to do this step by step.

Kaluga is available on Maven Central. For example the Kaluga Alerts can be imported like this:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.splendo.kaluga:alerts:0.2.1")
}
```

You can also use the `SNAPSHOT` version based on the latest in the `develop` branch:

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.splendo.kaluga:alerts:0.2.2-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

**Please mind** that in order for kaluga to work properly on iOS it declares a [strict dependency](https://docs.gradle.org/7.0.2/userguide/rich_versions.html#sec:strict-version) on the [`native-mt` version of the `kotlinx.coroutines` library](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/tree/287a931d3b8ce#native). If you want to use a different version make your own strict dependency declaration. This can be done simply by adding `!!`, for example: `implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.5.2-native-mt!!")`.


To use kaluga with SwiftUI and/or Combine we have a [repo with Sourcery templates](https://github.com/splendo/kaluga-swiftui) to generate some Swift code to help get you started.

### Friends of kaluga

Of course not every possible functionality is provided by kaluga. However, this is often because other good multiplatform libraries that work nicely with kaluga already exist. These use similar patterns such as coroutines and `Flow`, and include the following:

Project | Usage
--- | ---
[kotlin-firebase-sdk](https://github.com/GitLiveApp/firebase-kotlin-sdk) | wraps most of the Firebase SDK APIs
[multiplatform-settings](https://github.com/russhwolf/multiplatform-settings) | store key/value data 
[SQLDelight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) | access SQLite (and other SQL database) 

Kaluga also uses some multiplatform libraries itself, so our thanks to:

Project | Usage
--- | ---
[kydra](https://github.com/PocketByte/kotlin-kydra-log) | powers the logging module
[stately](https://github.com/touchlab/Stately) | concurrency
[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) | dependency injection
