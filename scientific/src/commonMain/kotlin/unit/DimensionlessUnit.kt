/**
 * Dimensionless Quantity
 * is a quantity to which no physical dimension is assigned, also known as a bare, pure, or scalar quantity
 * or a quantity of dimension one,
 * with a corresponding constant of measurement in the SI of the constant one (or 1), which is not explicitly shown.
 *
 * "
 * 2.3.3 Dimensions of quantities
 * ...
 * There are quantities Q for which the defining equation is such that all of the dimensional
 * exponents in the equation for the dimension of Q are zero.
 * This is true in particular for any quantity that is defined as the ratio of two quantities of the same kind.
 * For example, the refractive index is the ratio of two speeds and the relative permittivity is
 * the ratio of the permittivity of a dielectric medium to that of free space.
 * Such quantities are simply numbers. The associated constant is the constant one, symbol 1,
 * although this is rarely explicitly written (see 5.4.7).
 * ...
 * The constant one is the neutral element of any system of units – necessary and present automatically.
 * There is no requirement to introduce it formally by decision.
 * Therefore, a formal traceability to the SI can be established through appropriate,
 * validated measurement procedures.
 *
 * 5.4.7 Stating quantity values being pure numbers
 *
 * As discussed in Section 2.3.3, values of quantities with constant one, are expressed simply as numbers.
 * The constant symbol 1 or constant name “one” are not explicitly shown.
 * SI prefix symbols can neither be attached to the symbol 1 nor to the name “one”,
 * therefore powers of 10 are used to express particularly large or small values.
 *
 * Quantities that are ratios of quantities of the same kind (for example length ratios and amount fractions)
 * have the option of being expressed with units (m/m, mol/mol) to aid the understanding of
 * the quantity being expressed and also allow the use of SI prefixes, if this is desirable (μm/m, nmol/mol).
 * Quantities relating to counting do not have this option, they are just numbers.
 *
 * The internationally recognized symbol % (percent) may be used with the SI.
 * When it is used, a space separates the number and the symbol %.
 * The symbol % should be used rather than the name “percent”.
 * In written text, however, the symbol % generally takes the meaning of “parts per hundred”.
 * Phrases such as “percentage by mass”, “percentage by volume”, or “percentage by amount of substance” shall not be used;
 * the extra information on the quantity should instead be conveyed in the description and symbol for the quantity.
 * "
