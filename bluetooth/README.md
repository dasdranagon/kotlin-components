## Permissions

This library provide support for out-of-the-box access to Bluetooth.


### Usage
Create a `Bluetooth` object through the `BluetoothBuilder`. This gives you access to a `Flow` of Bluetooth devices. To scan for devices simply call

```kotlin
bluetooth.startScanning(setOf(someUUID))
launch {
    bluetooth.devices().collect {}
}
///
bluetooth.stopScanning()
```
Bluetooth Scanning is managed by a state machine that will keep running as long as it is observed. It will automatically handle Permissions and Enabling/Disabling bluetooth on the device, although this behaviour can be disabled via the `BluetoothBuilder`
Devices are returned as a flow of `Device` objects, which manages the connection state of each device.

Devices can be grabbed via a getter method. This returns a flow on which the device can be connected/disconnected from. Services, Characteristics and Descriptors can be accessed via easy accessor methods.

```kotlin
launch {
    bluetooth.devices()[someUUID].advertisement().collect { advertisementData ->
        // handle Advertisement Data
    }   
}
// Connect to a device
bluetooth.devices()[someUUID].connect()

launch {
    bluetooth.devices()[someUUID].services()[serviceUUID].characteristics()[characteristicUUID].descriptors()[descriptorUUID].value().collect {
        // Observe value changes
    }
}

// Write data
bluetooth.devices()[someUUID].services()[serviceUUID].characteristics()[characteristicUUID].first().writeValue(newValue)

bluetooth.devices()[someUUID].disconnect()
```

### Android
You may notice that when you ask for kaluga's `Permission.Bluetooth` the android request alert will prompt `Location` permission. This behaviour is encountered because Android system requires Location to access the hardware identifiers of nearby external devices via Bluetooth.

In order to setup a bluetooth repo on android you need to do the following:
```kotlin
// Somewhere in Android code
val permissions = Permissions(
    PermissionsBuilder().apply {
        registerBluetoothPermission()
        registerLocationPermission()
    }
)

val bluetoothBuilder = BluetoothBuilder(permissions = permissions)
CommonViewModel(bluetoothBuilder)
...

// Common code
class CommonViewModel(bltBuilder: BluetoothBuilder) : BaseViewModel() {
    private val repo: Bluetooth = bltBuilder.create(
        connectionSettings = ConnectionSettings(
            ConnectionSettings.ReconnectionSettings.Never
        ),
        autoRequestPermission = false
    )
} 
```
